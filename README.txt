## General Information
- EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
- The dataset contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


## Conclusions
-Key Drivers for loan default rate are identified with help of univariate and bivariate analysis.
